          <h1>Jobs in Computing</h1>
           <p>Computing is vast field which has evolved quickly in the past decade. 
             Computers previously needed an entire room to fit in, but now are reduced to the size of a watch. 
             Our dependence on computers were minimal but now we find it hard to pass a day without one. 
             This has its pros and cons. One main advantage is that it has increased the number of career opportunities. 
             Computing offers a variety of jobs which can be basic such as data entry or complex like programming. 
             A degree related to Computing gives access to advanced jobs like front-end development, game development, software engineering, cyber security, etc.</p>
            <p>For a job as a front-end developer, experience is required in one or more of the following HTML5, CSS, Java Script, Photoshop, AngularJS, Django, etc. 
              Front-end developers use their skills to create and maintain websites which are user friendly and follow principles of responsive web design. 
              A front-end developers’ annual salary ranges from £24,000 to £50,000.</p>
            <p>To work as software engineer, experience in one or more programming languages such as C, C++, Hadoop, Java, Python, Scala, Spark, SQL, Swift, etc. is required.
               Software engineers design, build, test and maintain software. They can develop software such as a small application or an entire operating system. A basic job in software engineering can have a yearly pay from £28,000 to £60,000.</p>
            <p>A job in game development must require skills in one or more game engine like Unity, Frostbite, Unreal, Cryengine, etc.
               Game developers design and maintain games for game consoles, mobile, tablets and PC. Game developers can earn from £20,000 to £50,000 annually.</p>
            <p>Each job has a certain set of requirements but it is easy to switch between jobs in computing.
               For example, a software engineer who has a little experience in HTML5, CSS or designing can work as a junior front-end developer and gain more knowledge and experience.
                Computing is an enormous field and the employments recorded just touch the most superficial layer of the genuine subject.</p>
